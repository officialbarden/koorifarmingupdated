- Do not use this datapack without providing appropriate credit!
## How to Use
- run the function file `kf:items` to get all blocks/entities that can be summoned.
- This datapack uses a power based system. Sources of Power are: `Wind Mill, Water Mill`. To get power from Wind Mill, place it at a high point. To get power from `Water Mill`, put flowing water just below the "trapdoor"
- Then, place down a power bank. Power Banks receive power and divert them to other machines.
